## Research Theme
The goal of the research group is to understand, predict and optimize the performance of composite structures during their life cycle, including design and development, manufacturing, etc. Through a coordinated effort in experimental, theoretical and computational studies, the group explores innovative solutions and sustainable practices for industrial applications of composite materials. The current research topics include
- **Design of high-performance composite structures**: \
   *Hybrid composites, Bio-inspired design, Impact, Damage tolerance, etc.*
- **Optimization of manufacturing process**: \
  *Precise manufacturing, Process-induced Distortions, Defects, Additive Manufacturing, etc.*
- **Development of numerical models and tools**: \
  *Damage and fracture, Multiscale modeling, Data-driven method, etc.*
